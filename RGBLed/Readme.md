#Arduino KY-016 3-color LED
RGB LED module consists of a plug-in full color LED made by R, G, B three pin PWM voltage input can be adjusted Section three primary colors (red / blue / green) strength in order to achieve full color mixing effect. Control of the module with the Arduino can be achieved Cool lighting effects.

#Specifications
the use of plug-in full-color LED
RGB trichromatic limiting resistor to prevent burnout
through the PWM adjusting three primary colors can be mixed to obtain different colors
with a variety of single-chip interface
the working voltage: 5V
LED drive mode: common cathode driver

#Schematic
Arduino pin 11 --> Pin R module
Arduino pin 10 --> Pin G module
Arduino pin 9 --> Pin B module
Arduino pin GND --> Pin - module
You don't need any resistors, these are already included on the module.
