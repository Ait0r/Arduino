#Arduino KY-021 Mini magnetic reed
A reed module is a magnetic sensor that is normally open and get closed when exposed to a magnetic field.
For this you need to keep a magnet near the sensor.
The module includes a 10 K Ohm resistor, so no additional parts needed.

#Schematic
* Arduino GND --> Module pin -
* Arduino +5V --> Module PLUS (middle pin)
* Arduino Digital pin 3 --> Module S
